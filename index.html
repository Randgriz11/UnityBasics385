1.Countdown: Instead of just counting down I made it display an image of a dog drinking pepsi that spins.

2. Moon Jump: Instead of a basic jump that only activates when on the ground I made it so less gravity and jump forever. Space to jump

3. Pause: Instead of only pause I made it so that there is a restart option and a Pepsi option that displays the same jpg as before

4.Bounce made it so the W and S keys make the ball go in right and left.

5. Made basic movement with W going up and S going down. Also added rotation with the A and D keys for my variation.
